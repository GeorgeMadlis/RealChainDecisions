# RealChainDecisions Repository Overview

## Objectives
This repository aims to address three core objectives:
1. **Simulation Environment Setup**: To simulate an environment capable of collecting and analyzing a real-time data stream produced by an IoT device on a single PC.
2. **Change Detection**: To identify abrupt changes within the time-series data generated by the IoT device.
3. **Blockchain Documentation**: To log the metadata of detected events onto a blockchain.

## Upcoming Features
- **Metadata Hashing**: Implement functions to generate and store off-chain hashes of the metadata and the detector code.
- **Blockchain Simulation**: Simulate the creation of blocks on a blockchain to ensure integrity and verifiability of the documented events.
